# Hidden Cam

This is a simple tool to test what happens in the background with a webpage navigation tab.

To use it, run `npm install` and then `npm start` to open the server.

You will need to open first `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` and keep that window visible at all times. Then, open only one other window in any browser to `http://localhost:3000` and play with minimizing or hiding that window; the dashboard will show changes.

You can also install http://localhost:3000 as a PWA to test what happens with an installed PWA.
